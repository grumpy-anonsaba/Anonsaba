Hello!

This is Anonsaba - 
I started on this Imageboard software when I was 17 years old.
It has grown over the many years - I have put it down, I have rewrote it, and I have done soo much.

I realized that all the top Imageboard software has since started to die out.
I decided to come back and recreate Anonsaba again with 3.0

What does this mean?
This means better security, faster processing, more thorough bug catches and many many more.

Anonsaba will always be a "wip" project. It's never ending.
It is currently being rewrote to use PHP 7.4 and above.

Anonsaba 2.0 was a rushed project that I just wanted to get done.
I cut a lot, I MEAN A LOT, of corners creating it.
I've decided to slow down however - 
I hope you enjoy my creation.

Anonsaba 3.0 will ALWAYS be free and opensource.
Knowledge is power and Knowledge should ALWAYS be free.
